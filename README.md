# BREADTH_FIRST_TREE_in_java
BFS stands for Breadth-First Search. It is an algorithm used to traverse or search a graph or tree data structure. BFS starts from a specific node (usually called the "source" or "starting" node) and explores all the neighbors of that node before moving on to their respective neighbors. The process continues until all nodes in the graph have been visited.

Key points about BFS:

1. Queue-based Approach: BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited. The nodes are inserted into the queue in the order they are discovered, and they are processed in the same order (first-in, first-out - FIFO).

2. Level Order Traversal: One of the significant properties of BFS is that it visits nodes level by level. In other words, it visits all nodes at the same distance from the source node before moving on to nodes that are at a greater distance.

3. Visited Nodes: To avoid revisiting nodes and to prevent infinite loops in the case of cyclic graphs, BFS keeps track of the nodes it has visited and ensures that each node is processed only once.

Pseudocode for BFS algorithm:

```
BFS(graph, source):
    queue = empty queue
    visited = empty set

    enqueue source into queue
    add source to visited set

    while queue is not empty:
        current = dequeue from queue
        process current node

        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor is not in visited set:
                add neighbor to visited set
                enqueue neighbor into queue
```

BFS is commonly used for several tasks, including:
- Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
- Testing if a graph is connected.
- Computing connected components of a graph.
- Web crawling and indexing.
- Solving puzzles and games that involve exploring possible moves.

BFS guarantees that it will find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or tree. The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph or tree.
